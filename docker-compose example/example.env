##================***================##
## These are the environment setup variables.
## Start setting up your instance from here.
## Syntax of the .env file is next:
## VARIABLE_NAME=variable value with everything after the '=' and till the end of the line.
## The variables with values, set in the docker-compose.yml directly, are for advanced configuration.
##================***================##

##----------Host variables-----------##
## This is the current folder, where all Photoview files and folders (except of your media library) are located
HOST_PHOTOVIEW_LOCATION=/opt/photoview

## This is where your original photos and videos located.
## Provide here the path to single root folder for your media collection.
HOST_PHOTOVIEW_MEDIA_ROOT=/your/root/media/folder
## If you'd like to map multiple folders from different locations, create additional variables
## here like the next one and modify the docker-compose.yml to match them and use in volume mappings.
# HOST_PHOTOVIEW_MEDIA_FAMILY=/full/path/to/folder

## This is where the Photoview data will be backed up
HOST_PHOTOVIEW_BACKUP=/media/Backup/PhotoView
##-----------------------------------##

##-------Photoview variables---------##
## PHOTOVIEW_DATABASE_DRIVER could have one of values: `postgres` (default), `mysql`, `sqlite`
PHOTOVIEW_DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres

## Define the external endpoint URL(s) where the Photoview UI will be accessible for users.
## This option is required when using a separate UI service and optional when Photoview serves the UI itself.
## It could be a single URL or a comma-separated list of URLs if multiple endpoints are used.
## Examples:
## PHOTOVIEW_UI_ENDPOINTS=https://host/
## PHOTOVIEW_UI_ENDPOINTS=https://host:8443/,https://localhost:8443/,https://gallery.example.com/
# PHOTOVIEW_UI_ENDPOINTS=https://host:8443/

## Define the host:port socket(s) where the separate Photoview UI service will listen for incoming connections.
## This option is required when using a separate UI service and unused when Photoview serves the UI itself.
## It could be a single socket or a space-separated list of sockets if multiple endpoints are used.
## Standard HTTPS port 443 can be skipped. Caddy assumes it by default if not specified explicitly.
## Can contain only the ":<port>" part, in which case Caddy will listen on all interfaces on that port.
## But then, there will be a certificate error in client browsers, because the certificate will be issued
## without thehostname. Make sure to keep the "localhost:8443" in the list (if not the :<port> case) to let
## the image health check pass.
## Examples:
## PHOTOVIEW_UI_SOCKETS=host localhost:8443
## PHOTOVIEW_UI_SOCKETS=host:8443 localhost:8443 gallery.example.com
# PHOTOVIEW_UI_SOCKETS=:8443

## Optional: To enable map related features, you need to create a mapbox token.
## A token can be generated for free here https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/
## It's a good idea to limit the scope of the token to your own domain, to prevent others from using it.
# MAPBOX_TOKEN=yourToken

## Optional Cookie Security Configuration
## Set to 'true' to enable the secure flag on cookies.
## This should only be enabled when the application is served over HTTPS.
## When enabled, cookies will only be transmitted over secure (HTTPS) connections.
## Default: not set (secure flag disabled)
# UI_COOKIE_SECURE=true

## Optional Cookie Security Configuration
## Set the domain attribute for cookies to enable sharing across subdomains.
## For example, set to '.example.com' to share cookies across all subdomains of example.com
## (e.g., photoview.example.com, photo-gallery.example.com).
## Leave unset or empty for single-domain deployments.
## Default: not set (cookies are bound to the exact hostname)
# UI_COOKIE_DOMAIN=.example.com
##-----------------------------------##

##----------Video variables----------##
## Set the hardware acceleration when encoding videos.
## Support `qsv`, `vaapi`, `nvenc`.
## Only `qsv` is verified with `/dev/dri` devices.
# PHOTOVIEW_VIDEO_HARDWARE_ACCELERATION=
##-----------------------------------##

##-------PostgreSQL variables--------##
## Comment out  the next lines if PHOTOVIEW_DATABASE_DRIVER is `mysql` or `sqlite`
## Use password generator to generate secret values and replace these defaults
PGSQL_DATABASE=photoview
PGSQL_USER=photoview
PGSQL_PASSWORD=superphotosecret
## See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html for possible ssl modes
PGSQL_SSL_MODE=prefer
##-----------------------------------##

##--------MariaDB variables----------##
## Uncomment these variables if PHOTOVIEW_DATABASE_DRIVER is `mysql`
## Use password generator to generate secret values and replace these defaults
# MARIADB_DATABASE=photoview
# MARIADB_USER=photoview
## Note: If your `MARIADB_PASSWORD` contains special characters (e.g. `@`), make sure to URL-encode them.
# MARIADB_PASSWORD=photosecret
# MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=superphotosecret
##-----------------------------------##

##---------SQLite variables----------##
## Uncomment the next line if PHOTOVIEW_DATABASE_DRIVER is `sqlite`
# PHOTOVIEW_SQLITE_PATH=/home/photoview/database/photoview.db
##-----------------------------------##

##-------Watchtower variables--------##
## The POLL_INTERVAL in sec
WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL=86400
WATCHTOWER_TIMEOUT=30s
WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true
